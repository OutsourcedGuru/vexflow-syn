# vexflow-syn
A synesthesic (relating to synesthesia) approach to coloring music notation in JavaScript by note.

This projects builds on the excellent JavaScript library [https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow](vexflow) by 0xfe. See also [http://www.vexflow.com](vexflow.com) for more information and tutorials.

Wikipedia defines synesthesia as "a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway".

According to http://synspectrum.com/synesthesia.html, the author experiences the following colors associated with these notes:

<table>
<tr><td>C:</td><td>white</td></tr>
<tr><td>C#/Db:</td><td>somewhat-metallic navy blue</td></tr>
<tr><td>D:</td><td>gray-green</td></tr>
<tr><td>D#:</td><td>yellow-green</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eb:</td><td>metallic gold</td></tr>
<tr><td>E:</td><td>bright yellow</td></tr>
<tr><td>F:</td><td>crimson red, tending toward magenta (very vivid and rich)</td></tr>
<tr><td>F#:</td><td>maroon, a bit redder</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gb:</td><td>metallic maroon, slightly darker</td></tr>
<tr><td>G:</td><td>brown-orange, browner the lower the note is</td></tr>
<tr><td>G#:</td><td>bright/matte-finish orange-copper</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ab:</td><td>metallic copper/brass</td></tr>
<tr><td>A:</td><td>orange</td></tr>
<tr><td>A#:</td><td>magenta</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bb:</td><td>beautiful royal purple--more violet, reddish-purple hue</td></tr>
<tr><td>B:</td><td>a very crisp black</td></tr>
</table>

Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915), Hélène Grimaud (1969-), Franz Liszt (1811-1886), Itzhak Perman (1945-), Duke Ellington (1899-1974, Joachim Raff (1822-1882), Jean Sibelius (1865-1957), György Ligeti (1923-2006), Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908), Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992) and David Hockney (1937) all were famous musicians and composers who wrote about their own synesthesia and how it affected them personally.

## A strategy for coloring notation
Since I've not been able to determine a commonality or consensus among the anecdotal collective evidence of existing writings, I've decided to issue colors based upon a common childhood toy from kindergarten:  the xylophone.
